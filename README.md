# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes coffee shop sales data using SQL and Power BI. The dashboard visualizes key sales metrics, trends, and insights to help understand performance across different time periods and product categories.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** for data extraction and transformation
- **Power BI** for data visualization and dashboard creation

## Challenges & Solutions
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: The dataset contained inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicate records. These were handled using SQL techniques like `COALESCE`, `JOINs`, and filtering out invalid data.
2. **Aggregating Sales Data**: Required complex queries to calculate total sales, orders, and quantities sold across different dimensions (time, location, category).
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimized queries to improve dashboard performance by indexing key columns and avoiding unnecessary computations.
4. **Visual Representation**: Designed an intuitive Power BI dashboard with filters and breakdowns to enhance user experience and decision-making.

## Key Insights
- **Total Sales** reached **$156.7K** in May 2023, with a **31.8% increase** from the previous month.
- **Coffee** is the best-selling category, contributing to over **60K in sales**.
- **Weekday sales** dominate with **$116.6K (74.4%)**, compared to **$40.1K (25.5%)** on weekends.
